## Installation

There are three ways to install:

- As a [gem-based theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes).
- As a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) (GitHub Pages compatible).
- Forking/directly copying all of the theme files into your project.

### Gem-based Theme Method

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-yat"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-yat
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll-theme-yat
```

### Remote Theme Method with GitHub Pages

Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require `Gemfile` changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages.

To install:

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
# theme: owner/name --> Don't forget to remove/comment the gem-based theme option
remote_theme: "jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

### Forking/Cloning the project

You need to update the option of github workflow file `.github/workflows/build-jekyll.yml`, especially to ensure the value of `jekyll_baseurl` is correct.

### GitHub Pages without limitation

GitHub Pages runs in `safe` mode and only allows [a set of whitelisted plugins/themes](https://pages.github.com/versions/). **In other words, the third-party gems will not work normally**.

To use the third-party gem in GitHub Pages without limitation:

Here is a GitHub Action named [jekyll-deploy-action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action) for Jekyll site deployment conveniently. üëç
